<p style="color:White">Color is such a fundamental part of the way we perceive the world that we often take it for granted. Think about it: From the youthful and vivid orange on someone's attire to the gray and gloomy sky above us, colors have the power to mold our perceptions of others and even the circumstances we find ourselves in.

This is why one of the most powerful tools in a designer's arsenal is color. It can either make or break a design; it can be the determining factor in engaging viewers or sending them promptly on their way.

Unless you're a seasoned designer, it takes time and effort to find a color combination that works within your website's design principles, which is why the design team at Visme decided to provide our users with a handy list of beautiful color schemes from websites that have been recognized by Awwwards, the most prestigious award for Web designers and developers.
